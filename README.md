# Friction-Measuring-Device
Friction Measuring Device constructed using LEGO NXT as part of first-year university robotics project (Collaborative)

Contributors: Dimitris Alexandridis, Andrew Lam, Edward Saunders.

The robot was programmed in MATLAB. The code consists of an initialisation procedure (robot figures out position in space), a periodic measurement position (robot moves away from fixed wall, increasing the tension of a spring that connects it with the wall), break procedure (robot realises that it has slipped and derives coefficient of static friction using the extension of the spring at which the slip occurred).

Our team was awarded a prize for the best scientific instrument among 120 teams.
